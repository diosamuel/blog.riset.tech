Imagine a frog, who doesnt have anything to do, but step the stone? he grabbed all way food by step each stone by stone, all days, jumping another stone by stone, in river.

The frog is just want to moving from one place to another place, no intention, the hell their thinking is just how to safely go to the final place.

here comes the biggest stone, and long stone, its like about 4x wider than himself, the reward are amazing, he can get more than he imagine he can it, absolutely life changed but the irony he cant jump onto it.

so he learn to the nearest school, teach himself about how to jump, practicing jump about 10x times per days, meet mentors like "froggie the jumper" to learn how to jump, even without shoes (absolutely frog dont have shoes!).

in the next 4 years, he confident that he can jump, so he try to jump, jumping the stone that he scared of it about 3 years,

and he fails...

because he lying about the jump that he never make.
